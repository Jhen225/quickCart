# quickCart

##Overview

> Quickcart is an idea for a project that I had that would ultimately be a way for someone to scan the barcodes of the items as they shopped and save it as a list. 
> It would feature some way to communicate with a store's system to pull price data and show accurate pricing. 
> At the register a user would be able to scan a barcode generated in the app or use NFC to transfer that data to the register. 
> This would speed up the wait times at the register by a lot.
